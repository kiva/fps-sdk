# Error Resolutions

## 403 Unauthorized Errors
If you get a 403 Unauthorized error, it means that your token is not valid. This could be because your token has expired, or because you are trying to access an API that you do not have access to.

To resolve this error, start by getting a new token with the correct scope. 
See [Details On Scope](/docs/overview/authentication#details-on-scope) for more information on scopes and how to apply them.
