Is with great joy that we are publishing this new portal today. The Kiva Partner API was conceived
to increase integration, and the success rate of using the Kiva Marketplace to fund global microloans.

On this new portal we will document new ways to integrate with the API, as well as sharing all of
what we have learned from working with our Partners.

Stay tuned.
